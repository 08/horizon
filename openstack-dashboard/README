===================
OpenStack Dashboard
===================

The OpenStack Dashboard is a reference implementation of a Django site that
uses the Horizon project to provide web based interactions with the various
OpenStack projects.


Getting Started
===============

For local development, first create a virtualenv for the project.
A tool is included to create one for you:

  $ python tools/install_venv.py

Now that the virtualenv is created, you need to configure your local
environment.  To do this, create a ``local_settings.py`` file in the ``local/``
directory.  There is a ``local_settings.py.example`` file there that may be
used as a template.

If all is well you should now able to run the server locally:

  $ tools/with_venv.sh dashboard/manage.py runserver

Settings Up OpenStack
=====================

The recommended tool for installing and configuring the core OpenStack
components is `Devstack`_. Refer to their documentation for getting
Nova, Keystone, Glance, etc. up and running.
