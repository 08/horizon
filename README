OpenStack Dashboard
-------------------

The OpenStack Dashboard is a Django based reference implementation of a web
based managent interface for OpenStack Nova.

It is based on django-nova, which is designed to be a generic Django module
that can be re-used in other sites.

For more information about how to get started with the OpenStack Dashboard,
view the README file in the openstack-dashboard folder.

For more information about working directly with django-nova, see the
README file in the django-nova folder.
